The top folders are the workspace folders for CCS. Within these folders are the individual project folders. Since the labs usually require opening up several projects there will be some extra projects within the workspace folder. The final projects for the lab will be in the folder named Lab[#]. For example the code to Lab 1 will be in "Lab1/Lab1".
